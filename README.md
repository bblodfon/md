# medStatSolutions

This repo includes all relavant files (mostly R and Jupyter notebooks) 
that I submitted as solutions to the homework exercises for the PhD 
course **KLMED8004: Medical Statistics (Part 1)**, offered by NTNU during
the Autumn of 2018. The homework consisted of exercises from the book 
*Fundamentals of Biostatistics*, B. Rosner, 8th Edition.
